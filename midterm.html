                <p> 
                    We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our 
                    monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We 
                    also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new 
                    purchases.
