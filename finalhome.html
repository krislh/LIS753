                    <p>I like cooking and baking. Hate cleaning up the kitchen afterwards, but that's just unavoidable. </p>
                    <p>But like most people, I rarely have as much time as I would like to spend on cooking and baking as I would like. Even working remotely, I spend a full work day in front of my computer, in meetings, writing reports, etc. Then when my work day is done I switch over to homework for a few hours and that doesn't leave much time to cook elaborate meals.</p> 
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Considering my mild distain for cleaning and washing dishes by hand, I generally look for recipes that minimize the number of tools that I will need. One bowl or one pot is perfect. When I look for recipes, I not only think about if I'll enjoy eating it but I try to determine if I will actually make this. Perhaps the recipe looks good, but requires that I use a mixer, multiple bowls, pans, food processor, or whatever other tools. I'm not gonna love making it.</p>
                    <p>In truth I've only included a couple recipes that I've made recently that I enjoyed because they were easy for me to grab. I included two baked goods and my favorite way of roasting broccoli with the best garlic sauce. I love garlic, and use this garlic sauce on so many differnt things. Sometimes I'm lazy and buy a similar sauce from the store but the homemade is the best.</p>
